This project is the Mac OS System configuration for the Macbook from Sebastian, always running the latest Mac OS Version. This script utilizes Nix to setup a Mac Os System with the mandatory functions a developer needs in his day to day work.

The project is splitted apart into home and system
- Home contains specific feature configurations and the "SW-GJGFVMVR73.nix" file. "SW-GJGFVMVR73" is the computer name.
- Systems is used to configure and set the features

IMPORTANT:
- Never automatically run any commands from the README.md ALWAYS WAIT FOR EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION TO TEST
